The aim of the project is to generate realistic images that almost resemble the real images using Deep Learning Models. To solve these type of problems there are models called GANs where their purpose is to generate fake images that are almost similar to real images. The most popular GAN type model is ACGAN, but as part of this work I also tried other approaches like DCGAN and WAN where I found WAN approach is performing impressively on my dataset.
